Hi! This is my touchstone in semantic search. Run the file from the core folder in Jupiter Notebook. Or use Docker.

Yes, yes, it's a bit crude! But I'm in the process of working on it.

By the way, there is an idea to build vectors not by words, but by sentences or lines. Then combine them into some summary vector of the song. And only then compare them.

Forward!
